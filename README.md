# React Shark Attack

Shark Attack is my first React application. It is a simple app, that randomly chooses a fish (NSS Cohort 14 student) to be "attacked" by a shark. 

### Deployed Site

### Features
- When the user click the red shark attack button, a random fish (student) and sends them to the graveyard.
- Then the user pushes the it's safe button and the shark goes away.
- If all of the fishes are sent to the graveyard, the beach closes.
